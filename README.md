# Remote-Object-Detection-with-Google-Coral-and-Sixfab-CORE
In this project, we will perform object detection with Coral on the picture we took on the Raspberry Pi, which we provide cellular connection, and we will do all of these operations remotely and quickly.

Ready? Let's get started! ðŸš€
## Hardware setup
Here's how and what you're ging to build:
1. Attach the Telit LE910C1 mini PCIe(or compatible modules) module to the HAT.

2. Attach the antenna to the mini PCIe module. I recommend sticking the antennas as in the picture.

3. Attach 40 pin header to the Base HAT that comes with the HAT and insert the Sixfab SIM to Base HAT.

4. Connect the camera module.
